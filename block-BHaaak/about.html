                          <h3>South Africa have won the toss and have opted to bat</h3>
                          <p>South Africa don't have the greatest ODI record of late, and it's something they'll be keen to rectify under Bavuma. This series seems like a good opportunity to test out certain combinations.
                            Much has gone on behind the scenes with Kohli giving up Test captaincy as well. Naturally the focus will be on him, as it will be on de Kock who pulled a shocker as he announced his retirement from the longest format.</p>

                          <h3>Why SA-India series is not part of ODI Super League</h3>
                          <p>The ongoing South Africa-India One-Day International series, which started on Wednesday (January 19), is not part of the ODI Super League, which is a means to qualification for the ICC World Cup in 2023. According to ICC, all ODIs played towards the build-up to the World Cup are not, necessarily, part of the Super League. Only pre-decided series are.</p>
