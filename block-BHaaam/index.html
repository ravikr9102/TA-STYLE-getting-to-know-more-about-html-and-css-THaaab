                <p>Perhaps one lesson to be taken from the past two years is that the country needs contingency plans to run mass-vaccination programmes, whether against Omicron (if new vaccines should be needed), some other new variant of Covid-19 or indeed, whatever the next pandemic should be. While the ability of the NHS, local government and other services to respond at scale in a crisis is astounding, the cost to routine services and to the patients and users that rely on them is all too clear and any future plan will need to think carefully about where staff and resources for vaccination programmes (or indeed, other emergency measures) are to come from.

                <p>We will again need to return the plans for the recovery of health and social care. A plan for elective recovery was on the launch pad just as Omicron first appeared but there can be no avoiding the fact that winter 2021/22 will make that challenge harder, as it will do across all services. Switching-off routine (but essential) services to re-allocate staff into the vaccine programme and to free up hospital space for Covid-19 patients sadly can only make the backlogs â€“ whether in the acute sector, mental health, general practice or elsewhere â€“ worse. In addition, Covid-19 shone a bright light on the already-high health inequalities that existed before the pandemic and the agenda becomes even more challenging when we accept that reducing these inequalities should be core to recovery. The key to this in 2021 was pragmatism:</p>
